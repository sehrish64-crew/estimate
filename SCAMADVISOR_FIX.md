## ✅ Quick Fixes (Do These First)

### 1. **Verify Site is Accessible**
Open these URLs in your browser - all should load without errors:

```
https://trueautocheck.com/
https://trueautocheck.com/sitemap.xml
https://trueautocheck.com/robots.txt
https://trueautocheck.com/health
```

✅ If all load fine → Move to Step 2

❌ If any shows error → Your site has a problem that needs fixing

---

### 2. **Check robots.txt is Correct**

Your `robots.txt` should look like this:

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: [/admin, /api, /checkout, /*.json$]

Sitemap: https://trueautocheck.com/sitemap.xml
```

✅ Go to: https://trueautocheck.com/robots.txt and verify

---

### 3. **Verify sitemap.xml Exists**

Your sitemap should include all main pages:

```
https://trueautocheck.com/
https://trueautocheck.com/about-us
https://trueautocheck.com/pricing
https://trueautocheck.com/contact-us
https://trueautocheck.com/privacy
https://trueautocheck.com/terms
etc...
```

✅ Check: https://trueautocheck.com/sitemap.xml

---

### 4. **Ensure Homepage Metadata is Correct**

Your homepage should have:
- ✅ Title tag: "TrueAutoCheck - Check any car's history"
- ✅ Meta description: "VIN Check Can Save You Thousands..."
- ✅ Open Graph tags for social media
- ✅ Structured data (JSON-LD)

These are already in your Next.js layout.tsx ✓

### 5. **Fix Database Connection Issues (Most Common)**

The main issue is likely **database connection errors** on Hostinger preventing proper page rendering.

**On Hostinger Control Panel:**

1. Go to **Hosting** → Your Website
2. Go to **Node.js** → Your Application → **Edit**
3. Check Environment Variables are set:
   ```
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USER=u319625572_trueautocheck
   DB_PASSWORD=Trueautocheck321@
   DB_NAME=u319625572_trueautocheck
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://trueautocheck.com
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin123@Secure
   ```

4. **Restart Node.js Application**

5. Test: https://trueautocheck.com/api/test-db
   - Should show: `{"message":"Database connected successfully!"}`
   - NOT a 500 error

---

### 6. **Check Page Response Headers**

Your pages should return HTTP 200 (success), not 500 (error).

Using curl or browser dev tools:
```bash
curl -I https://trueautocheck.com/
```

Should show: `HTTP/2 200`

NOT: `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`

---

## 🔄 What to Do After Fixes

### **Step 1: Verify Everything Works**

Test these URLs all return 200 status:
- https://trueautocheck.com/
- https://trueautocheck.com/pricing
- https://trueautocheck.com/about-us
- https://trueautocheck.com/contact-us
- https://trueautocheck.com/robots.txt
- https://trueautocheck.com/sitemap.xml

### **Step 2: Re-submit to ScamAdvisor**

1. Go to https://www.scamadvisor.com/
2. Click "Verify your site"
3. Enter: https://trueautocheck.com
4. Wait for analysis (can take 5-30 minutes)

### **Step 3: Wait 48 Hours**

## 🚀 If Still Not Working

Check these logs on Hostinger:
